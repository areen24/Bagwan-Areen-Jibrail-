    <h3>Achievements</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Since my early youth I have had an affinity for puzzles.
             In 6th grade, all my free time was dedicated to the art of putting together puzzles.
             More than likely I skipped out on homework just to work some puzzles.
              I didn’t have many friends and this was the way in which I began self-definition. After my parents’ divorce, my sister
               and I were separated and up until that time in my life, she was the main influence for my personality. While my sister was great,
                I definitely had something unique about myself. Through excessive puzzle completing, I learned that my skill was problem-solving and 
                that I was only helping the skill to grow through my puzzles. To this day I still find a joy in problem-solving.
